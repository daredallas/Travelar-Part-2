<h2>Usability Goals</h2>		

<p>
Able to provide specific user interfaces for different situations (keyboard, star rating, directions)<br><br>
Controls can be used in both landscape and portrait orientation<br><br>
Able to preload nearby location data when the app is opened<br><br>
Able to provide relevant data for locations within a second (if not preloaded)<br><br>
Able to collect user information anonymously to improve services<br><br>
New users able to find their first interactive location within 30 seconds of opening the app<br><br>
Rating a location takes less than 30 seconds + the time it takes to type in a comment.<br><br>
Minimal learning curve: the user should remember how to perform a task after having perfomed it once.<br><br>
The app should not allow the user to get lost in their surroundings. <br><br><br>
