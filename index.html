<h2>Introduction</h2>

			
			<p id="main-paragraph">Tourism is an enormous industry and with the prevalence of phones and access to information throughout the world, it is easier than ever for people to experience different locales. However, unfamiliarity can be a problem that keeps many travellers from fully experiencing the location around them. Since almost every traveller will bring at least a smartphone, there are many opportunities to use the platforms they already have to solve their problems. We are proposing an augmented reality travel app, with the goal to provide an easily usable application which enhances a travellerâ€™s experience with valuable information about their surroundings. </p>

<h2>Data Requirements</h2>

			
			<p id="main-paragraph">For this application to work, both local and cloud data is necessary. Locally, the application would first need permission to use the camera for example, a system pop up in iOS. Another basic requirement would be for location services to be on in order to have a geographic location as context for the application. With geographical location, the Google Maps platform would provide more relevant context about the surrounding areas and what attractions there are. From cloud services, machine learning algorithms which would have been trained with popular locations are streamed onto the phone within a certain radius of the user. The amount of relevant information would differ where the closest attractions have the most detail loaded in while locations further away have primitive information that acts as a trigger if it is recognized. In early stages, this usage would be limited to certain areas so that good accuracy of image recognition can be experienced. </p>
