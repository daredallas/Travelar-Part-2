<h2>Data Requirements and Widgets</h2>

			
			<p id="main-paragraph">For this application to work, both local and cloud data is necessary. Locally, the application would first need permission to use the camera for example, a system pop up in iOS. Another basic requirement would be for location services to be on in order to have a geographic location as context for the application. With geographical location, the Google Maps platform would provide more relevant context about the surrounding areas and what attractions there are. From cloud services, machine learning algorithms which would have been trained with popular locations are streamed onto the phone within a certain radius of the user. The amount of relevant information would differ where the closest attractions have the most detail loaded in while locations further away have primitive information that acts as a trigger if it is recognized. In early stages, this usage would be limited to certain areas so that good accuracy of image recognition can be experienced. </p>

<h2>Designing for Requirements</h2>

			
			<p id="main-paragraph">Some primary goals for the application is to have simple and low-profile user interaction. One aspect is for only a small portion of the screen space be dedicated to user feedback for example, the descriptors for detected attractions. As a result, this application acts like augmented reality where the display is still focused on the view in basic use. In some areas of the world, wonderful but hidden shops might be inconspicuous to tourists but with powerful image recognition, these locations would be apparent for users. However, in order to keep the view from getting cluttered, we have limited the amount of pop-ups that can be active at one time. From this design, popular locations are presented first which is more useful when viewing from a further distance but when close to the attractions, the bubbles act as signs for each location. For more specific details, please visit the User Experience and Usability tabs.</p>

<h2>Stylization</h2>

			
			<p id="main-paragraph"> The style and aesthetics of a program is a feature that is not noticed by users often but can have a big impact for users. We decided to use the Open Sans font because it provides a clear yet aesthetically pleasing experience. To complement the simple font, we decided to provide a small menu button that activates upon the user pressing it. Also, for users that want more details, this application provides a standard and familiar text based pop-up. For example, if a user wants more information from a restaurant, they are directed to click the prompt with the tag of the restaurant, then a more advanced listing is displayed with the menu providing an intuitive pathway to the desired information.</p>
